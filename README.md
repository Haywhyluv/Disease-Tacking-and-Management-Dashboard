# **Disease Tracking and Management Dashboard**  

## **Project Summary**  
The **Disease Tracking and Management Dashboard** is an advanced visualization tool designed to monitor and analyze disease patterns across various demographics, locations, and time periods. It provides critical insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers to enhance resource allocation and decision-making.  

## **Key Objectives**  
- **Case Monitoring:** Differentiating between confirmed and unconfirmed cases by location and demographic.  
- **Serotype Distribution:** Analyzing disease variations among affected populations.  
- **Survival & Mortality Analysis:** Evaluating survival rates across different groups.  
- **State-Level Insights:** Identifying regions most and least affected by disease.  
- **Demographic Trends:** Assessing disease impact based on gender, age, and settlement type.  

## **Dashboard Features**  

### **1. Settlement-Based Analysis**  
- **Urban vs. Rural Cases:** Rural areas report higher disease cases than urban regions.  
- **Survival Rate:** Mortality rates are slightly higher in rural settings.  

### **2. Serotype Distribution**  
- Disease cases categorized by specific serotypes with survival comparisons.  

### **3. Demographic Insights**  
- **Gender:** Males show a marginally higher rate of confirmed cases.  
- **Age:** Cases are consistently distributed across age groups.  

### **4. Health Status Breakdown**  
- Displays the proportion of living and deceased cases by gender.  

### **5. State-Level Impact**  
- **Most Affected States:** Includes Oyo, Abia, and Lagos, requiring urgent intervention.  
- **Least Affected States:** Indicating either successful containment or low reporting.  

### **6. Time-Based Trends**  
- Yearly fluctuations in survival and mortality rates from 2009 to 2018.  

## **Data & Tools**  
- **Data Sources:** Health records tracking settlements, demographics, serotypes, and yearly trends.  
- **Technologies Used:** Microsoft Excel, SQL, Power BI, GitHub.  

## **Key Insights**  
- Disease burden is higher in rural areas.  
- Males have a slightly higher case rate than females.  
- Certain states face a significantly greater impact.  
- Disease trends fluctuate over time, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring.  

## **Next Steps**  
- Introduce real-time data updates.  
- Incorporate socio-economic factors for deeper analysis.  
- Develop predictive models for outbreak forecasting.
